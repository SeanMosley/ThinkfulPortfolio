        <!--below are paragraphs explaining who I am-->
        Just so you know a little about who I am, I am an Army Reservist who
        lives
        <br />
        in Atlanta, GA. Next month in February I would be in for four years. I
        am
        <br />
        also a full time student at Full Sail University pursuing my bachelors
        in the <br />
        Web Development program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I moved to Georgia I was a Military brat, so I traveled to many
        places such as North Carolina,<br />
        to California and then back across the country to Louisiana. But my
        favorite place by <br />
        far was living in Iwakuni Japan, I lived there for six years and had a
        wonderful experience.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Originally, before I went to Full Sail, in High School I wanted to go
        there for graphic design. But as years passed I ran across a YouTuber by
        the name of Chris Sean and he inspired me to begin learning code. He
        showed me that front-end development is a way to show "art" in a
        different way. This is why once I came back from training and trying to
        do the self-taught path I eventually applied at Full Sail and got
        accepted into the Web Development program. I have done courses on
        Codecademy, Udemy, Sololearn, and other applications to help me try to
        further my coding experience. Even though I have done all of that I am
        still only scraping the surface of code. I felt like I needed a mentor
        and a different learning style and that is why I was happy I ran across
        Thinkful Bootcamp. <br />
        Being in the Army has taught me how to work, lead, and learn with and
        from others. Every time I go to drill my Sergeants preach about how we
        always need to work as a team and not as individuals, which I completely
        agree with. I believe that I am a true team player and always try to
        make sure everybody is included. My dream job is to eventually work for
        Twitch and become a front-end developer there. Like my idle Chris Sean,
        he works there and he is now a streamer for them as well teaching people
        code in real-time and always inspiring, that is what I hope to do in the
        future once I build more on my skills. An interest of my mine is
        watching and finding new animes. No, it is not because I lived in Japan
        but just because I've always loved it. I also enjoy spending time with
        my girlfriend has changed my life in many ways and I am very grateful.
